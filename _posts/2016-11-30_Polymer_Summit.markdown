title: Polymer? Polymer!

After I started at [SW][SW] at the beginning of October, I already travelled to London two weeks later. The reason: [Polymer][polymer] [Summit][summit].
Two days full of talks, more talks, discussions, Codelabs and networking with a lot of people.

I've never done anything with Polymer so far, except some very small introduction tutorials.

And again for some friends: No, Polymer isn't a synthetic material.
